# Quick Implementation Guide - 快速實施指南

This guide provides a streamlined path to implement the Fridge Temperature Controller IC from RTL to GDSII.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed the [Development Environment Setup](development_environment_setup.md).

## 📋 Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: RTL Verification (步驟 1-3)

#### Step 1: Clone and Setup Project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url] fridge_temp_controller_sky130
cd fridge_temp_controller_sky130

# Source environment
source env_setup.sh
```

#### Step 2: Run RTL Simulations
```bash
cd testbench

# Run top-level simulation
make sim_top

# View waveforms (optional)
make wave_top

# Run PID controller test
make sim_pid
```

#### Step 3: Verify Simulation Results
- Check console output for PASS/FAIL status
- Verify temperature control within ±0.5°C
- Confirm PWM generation
- Validate state machine transitions

### Phase 2: Logic Synthesis (步驟 4)

#### Step 4: Run Yosys Synthesis
```bash
cd ../synthesis

# Run synthesis script
./run_synthesis.sh

# Check results
cat results/synth_report.txt
```

Expected results:
- Gate count: ~5,000-10,000
- Critical path: < 100ns (10MHz operation)
- No timing violations

### Phase 3: Physical Design (步驟 5-6)

#### Step 5: Configure OpenLane
```bash
cd ../openlane

# Review configuration
cat config.json

# Key parameters to verify:
# - CLOCK_PERIOD: 100 (10MHz)
# - DIE_AREA: "0 0 500 500"
# - TARGET_DENSITY: 0.5
```

#### Step 6: Run OpenLane Flow
```bash
# Run the complete flow
./run_openlane.sh

# Select option 1 for full flow
# This will take 30-60 minutes
```

### Phase 4: Verification (步驟 7-8)

#### Step 7: Check Results
```bash
# Navigate to results
cd runs/[latest_run]/

# Check key metrics:
cat reports/final_summary_report.csv

# Verify:
# - Area < 0.5 mm²
# - Power < 5 mW
# - No DRC violations
# - No timing violations
```

#### Step 8: View Layout
```bash
# Open in Magic
magic -T $PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech \
      results/final/gds/temp_ctrl_top.gds

# Or use KLayout
klayout results/final/gds/temp_ctrl_top.gds
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### RTL Simulation Fails
```bash
# Check for missing files
ls -la ../rtl/

# Verify Icarus Verilog installation
iverilog -V

# Check for syntax errors
make lint
```

### Synthesis Errors
```bash
# Check Yosys version
yosys -V

# Review constraints file
cat constraints.sdc

# Try simpler synthesis first
yosys synth_top.ys
```

### OpenLane Fails
```bash
# Check Docker
docker ps

# Verify PDK installation
ls $PDK_ROOT/sky130A/

# Check disk space
df -h

# Review logs
cat runs/*/logs/synthesis/synthesis.log
```
